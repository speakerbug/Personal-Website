# Personal Website

This project converts a static HTML/CSS site into a Next.js 14 application using the App Router and TypeScript.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site uses the `app/` directory with reusable components in `components/`, global styles in `styles/`, and static assets in `public/`.
